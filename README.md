## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me 
- 🔭 &nbsp; Hi,there! I’m Feiyu Zhou, Currently pursuing a Doctorate degree with [Prof. Shengying Yue](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/syyue) and [Prof. Yilun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/yilunliu) in solid mechanics at [State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/2021-03/30/c_607160.htm), [School of Aerospace Engineering](https://sae.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, 710049, China.
- 🤔 &nbsp; Simultaneously, I am a graduate student at [Cuiying Honors College](https://cycollege.lzu.edu.cn/) (China’s Top-notch Undergraduate training program 2.0), [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/). 
- 📧 &nbsp; Feel free to email me for academic cooperations: zhoufy.xjtu@gmail.cn
- 🔍 &nbsp; More detailed personal information: [My page](https://zhoufy20.github.io/) and [My Curriculum Vitae.](https://zhoufy20.github.io/files/cv/cv.pdf)

**My long-term research interests** lie at the intersection of solid mechanics, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence, with the overarching goal of addressing real-world engineering problems through physics-informed and data-driven approaches.

- Data-driven solid mechanics: Leveraging machine learning and statistical methods to enhance the modeling, simulation, and design of complex mechanical systems.

- AI for Science: Developing and applying modern AI techniques—including graph neural networks (GNNs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), operator learning, and large language models—to accelerate scientific discovery and modeling.

- Multi-scale mechanical modeling: Bridging scales from quantum mechanics (e.g., density functional theory) and molecular dynamics to continuum mechanics and phase-field modeling, aiming to connect theoretical understanding with practical applications.
